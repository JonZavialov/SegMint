# Segmint

Segmint segments code changes by intent.

Modern Git workflows operate on raw diffs and files. Segmint works at a higher level — it models repositories as structured changesets that AI agents can reason about.

Related edits are grouped together, commits become semantic units, and pull requests reflect actual engineering decisions.

Segmint bridges the gap between diffs and meaning — turning code changes into clean version history.
